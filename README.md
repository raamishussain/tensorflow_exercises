# tensorflow_exercises

This repository contains various projects which I have worked on using machine learning algorithms
implemented via Tensorflow.

All implementations use Tensorflow 2.5. Note that the code shown here will not be compatible with
Tensorflow 1.x due to substantial changes in the structure of Tensorflow between version 1 and 2.

A summary of the projects in this repository is shown below.
